# SQL-Query-Builder
This PHP application allows users to easily build and execute dynamic SQL queries on their MySQL database. It provides a user-friendly interface to:

Specify database connection details (name, username, password).
Enter the desired table name.
Select specific columns for retrieval (or choose "All" for all columns).
Submit the information to generate and execute the SQL query.
View the retrieved data displayed in a formatted table.
Features:

Dynamic Query Building: Based on user input, the application constructs the SQL query to select specific columns or all columns from a chosen table.
User-Friendly Interface: The form-based interface simplifies interaction and avoids the need for manual SQL writing.
Database Connectivity: Connects to a MySQL database using user-provided credentials.
Installation:

Clone or download the repository.
Place the files on a web server with PHP support.
(Optional) Edit the connection.php file to configure the default database connection details (if desired).
Usage:

Open the application in a web browser.
Enter your database connection details.
Specify the table name and desired columns (or "All").
Click "Submit" to execute the query and view the results.
Note:

This application requires a PHP-enabled web server and a MySQL database.
For security reasons, it's recommended not to store sensitive database credentials directly in the code. Consider environment variables or a separate configuration file.
Further Development:

Implement input validation and error handling for user input.
Enhance the UI with progress indicators or feedback messages.
Allow users to save and manage frequently used queries.
